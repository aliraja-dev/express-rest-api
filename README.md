# express-rest-api
This is part of a larger personal project that use AWS S3 for image uploads, AWS Rekognition for Face Matches, Passport for Social Login, Mongoose as ODM, Express as web framework and Node as a runtime. 

#Future
I will repurpose parts of this project for a MEAN CRUD Form application soon. And some fun celebrity face match app.
